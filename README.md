# VortexApp2
A new version that I am working on with PHP.

I was asked in an interview how to build instagram. I thought I would try it properly. (and modestly haha - a small scale version))

The best social media project I have done so far was Streamnote - but too many features made it far too complex.

I am still focusing on a mobile-app esque design primarily. 

I'm making a simple interface and trying my best to refactor as much code as I can.
